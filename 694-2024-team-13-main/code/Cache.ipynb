    "__Data to Cache__: based on the previous implementation for nonrelational and relational db, it seems like we should focus on caching popular hashtags and user data, which are frequently queried\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cache Storage__: use python dict to store cached data, with keys and hashatgs or userIDs and values as the data objects\n",
    "\n",
    "__Eviction policy__: implement an eviction policy such as '__Least recently used (LRU)__' to remove the least accessed items when the cache reaches its size limit\n",
    "\n",
    "__Persistent__: Periodically serialize and save the state of the cache to disk. On startup, deserialize the data to restore the cache state\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stale data handling__: entries in the cache can become stale if the dara in the db is updated. We need to implment a strategy to check for stale data and update/ rm as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "__Expiry mechanism__: Assign a time-to-live (TTL) to each cache entry. When an entry TTL expires, it should be considered for eviction."
